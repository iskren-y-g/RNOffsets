# RNOffsets
This script generates ranodom offsets, where no three consecutive offsets are within a certain minimum separation from each other. A temp.off file is written with a ; as a column separator (the format required for the LBT OT tool). The script also makes a small plot connecting with lines the three offsest per offset group. Use 'python3 rnoffsets.py -h' for the options.
